# Whisker Wisdom

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The application I built is called "Whisker Wisdom." It is a web application that provides interesting and fun cat facts to cat lovers. The app aims to entertain and educate users about cats while offering a delightful user experience.By offering a curated collection of cat facts and providing an enjoyable user experience, Whisker Wisdom caters to the interests and curiosity of cat lovers. It serves as a go-to resource for individuals seeking engaging cat-related content, ultimately providing entertainment and knowledge about our feline companions.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

 I would first provide them with the link to the main repository in which all working branches have been merged. Ask them to access the SSH code and 'git clone' down to their local terminal. From there they would open this directory in VS code / Atom. To access the site they would type  'open index.html' in their termianl to retrieve the HTML site itself. 

### Preview of App:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project were to gain experience in developing a web application using modern web technologies and frameworks. The project aimed to improve skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as utilizing a popular JavaScript framework like React.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: Used for styling and layout of the application components.
HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.
JavaScript: The primary programming language for interactivity and logic.
React Router: A library for handling routing in the React application.
Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating with others.
GitHub: Platform for hosting the code repository and facilitating collaboration.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Successful implementation of key features and functionality in the application, such as displaying cat facts, allowing users to mark favorites, and providing a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Achieving these goals demonstrates the ability to translate requirements into working features.Another win was the acquisition of knowledge and skills in working with React and related technologies like React Router. Learning and successfully using these tools in the project not only demonstrates growth as a developer but also opens up possibilities for future projects and collaboration within the React ecosystem.Designing and implementing a responsive user interface that works well across different devices and browsers can be challenging. It required thorough testing, utilizing media queries, and adopting best practices for responsive design. Researching and staying updated on cross-browser compatibility issues and applying appropriate techniques helped overcome these challenges.
